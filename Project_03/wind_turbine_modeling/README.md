# Wind turbine modeling using Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory
This is one of the three pre-defined final projects in [46W38 Scientific
Programming for Wind Energy](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/46w38), an 
E-learning course for the 
[Master of Wind Energy – Online Programme](https://lifelonglearning.dtu.dk/en/wind-energy/master-en/master-en-master-of-wind-energy-online-programme/)
provided by DTU Wind. 


The objective of this project is to develop a steady-state Blade Element 
Momentum (BEM) model to predict the aerodynamic performance of a wind turbine. 
The model will compute key performance metrics such as power output, thrust, 
and torque as functions of wind speed, rotor speed, and blade pitch angle.



## Background
Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory is the most widely used method for wind 
turbine aerodynamic modeling due to its balance between computational 
efficiency and accuracy. It combines momentum theory (global conservation of 
mass, momentum, and energy) with blade element theory (local aerodynamic forces 
on blade sections) to estimate rotor performance. BEM is critical for:

* **Design Optimization**: Evaluating blade geometry, pitch settings, and 
control strategies.

* **Power Curve Prediction**: Estimating annual energy production (AEP) under 
varying wind conditions.

* **Load Analysis**: Calculating thrust and torque for structural design.

For a more detailed introduction on the BEM theory, you are referred to the
textbook (Hansen, 2015) or the DTU MSc course [46300 Wind Turbine Technology 
and Aerodynamics](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2024-2025/46300?menulanguage=en).


### Typical BEM Workflow
1. **Input Parameters**:
    * Blade geometry (chord, twist, airfoil data along the span).
    * Operational conditions (wind speed, rotor speed, pitch angle).

2. **Momentum Theory**:
    Compute axial ($a$) and tangential ($a^\prime$) induction factors 
    using actuator disk theory.

3. **Blade Element Theory**:
Calculate lift and drag forces at each blade section using airfoil polars (e.g.
, $C_l$, $C_d$).

4. **Iterative Solution**:
Solve for induction factors that balance momentum and blade element equations, 
often requiring numerical iteration.

5. **Loss Corrections**:
Apply Prandtl’s tip/hub loss corrections to account for finite blade effects. 
Note that the minimal version of the code required in this project can ignore
this step.

6. **Performance Metrics**:
Integrate sectional forces to compute total power, thrust, and torque.

### Methodology
Consider a wind turbine rotor with radius $R$, we can consider a blade element
at span position $r$ with element length of $dr$, as shown in the following 
diagram:

We can then calculate the local solidity $\sigma(r)$, defined as the fraction 
of the annular area in the control volume, which is covered by blades as follows:

$$\sigma(r) = \frac{c(r)B}{2\pi r}$$

where $B$ denotes the number of blades that is 3 for the turbine we considered.


Assume the local chord length at this span position is $c(r)$, the local twist
angle is $\beta(r)$, and the rotor is operated at the following conditions:
* Inflow wind speed: $V_0$
* Blade pitch angle: $\theta_p$
* Rotational speed: $\omega$

Note that given the rotor radius $R$, the inflow wind speed $V_0$ and the 
rotational speed $\omega$, the tip speed ratio $\lambda$, or TSR, is given by:

$$ 
\lambda = \frac{\omega R}{V_0}
$$ 

Based on the procedure described in Chapter 6 of (Hansen 2015), the following
steps can be taken to solve the steady BEM equations to obtain the axial 
($a$) and tangential ($a^\prime$) induction factors and compute the 
contribution of thrust and torque of this blade element:

* **Step 1**: Initialize $a$ and $a^\prime$, typically $a=a^\prime=0$.

* **Step 2**: Compute the flow angle $\phi$ using the following equation:

$$
\tan \phi = \frac{(1-a)V_0}{(1+a^\prime)\omega r}
$$

* **Step 3**: Compute the local angle of attack $\alpha$ using the following 
equation:

$$
\alpha = \phi - (\theta_p + \beta)
$$

* **Step 4**: Compute $C_l(\alpha)$ and $C_d(\alpha)$ by interpolation based on
the airfoil polars.

* **Step 5**: Compute $C_n$ and $C_t$ with:

$$
C_n = C_l \cos\phi + C_d \sin\phi
$$

$$
C_t = C_l \sin\phi - C_d \cos\phi
$$

* **Step 6**: Update $a$ and $a^\prime$ with:

$$a = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 \phi/[\sigma(r) C_n] + 1}$$

$$a^\prime = \frac{1}{4 \sin \phi \cos \phi/[\sigma(r) C_t] - 1}$$

* **Step 7**: If $a$ and $a^\prime$ have changed more than a certain tolerance, 
go back to Step 2, otherwise continue to Step 8.

* **Step 8**: Compute the local contribution of this blade element to the 
thrust and torque as:

$$dT = 4 \pi r \rho V_0^2 a (1 -a) dr$$

$$dM = 4 \pi r^3 \rho V_0 \omega a^\prime (1 -a) dr$$

Loop over all blade elements, we can then integrate to get the thrust ($T$) and 
torque ($M$), then the (aerodynamic) power output of the rotor can be computed
as:

$$P = M \omega$$

Then thrust coefficient $C_T$ and power coefficient $C_P$ of the rotor can be
compuated from the following equations:

$$ T =\frac{1}{2} \rho A V_0^2 \cdot C_T $$

$$ P =\frac{1}{2} \rho A V_0^3 \cdot C_P $$

Here $\rho$ is the air density (can be set as 1.225 kg/m3 in this project),
$A=\pi R^2$ denotes the rotor area.

# Dynamic System Simulation with Python

This note presents the modeling process of a simple 1D dynamic system using
Python, which is very like the Project 2 in this course, but a simpler
version. Thus, **if you find Project 2 to be challenging, understanding
the 1D example in this note will be very beneficial.**

## Background

The mass-spring-damper system is a fundamental model in mechanical
engineering and physics that describes the behavior of many mechanical 
systems. According to the [Wikipedia model](
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-spring-damper_model), 
this system is governed by a second-order ordinary differential 
equation (ODE).

### Mathematical Model

The system follows the equation:

$$
m\ddot{x}(t) + c\dot{x}(t) + kx(t) = F(t)
$$

Where:
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $c$ = damping coefficient (N·s/m)
- $k$ = spring constant (N/m)
- $F(t)$ = external force (N)
- $ x(t) $ = position (m)
- $ \dot{x}(t) $ = velocity (m/s)
- $ \ddot{x}(t) $ = acceleration (m/s²)

### Physical Interpretation
- **Spring force**: $ -kx $ (restoring force proportional to 
displacement)
- **Damper force**: $ -c\dot{x} $ (dissipative force proportional to 
velocity)
- **External force**: $ F(t) $ (driving force applied to the system)

## Methodology

### Numerical Solution Approach

We solve this second-order ODE by converting it to a system of first-order ODEs using state-space representation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= v \\
\frac{dv}{dt} &= \frac{F(t) - cv - kx}{m}
\end{aligned}
$$

We use `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` with the Runge-Kutta method for numerical integration.

## Results and Analysis

### Case 1: Free Vibration

**System Parameters:**
- Mass ($ m $): 1.0 kg
- Damping ($ c $): 0.2 N·s/m  
- Stiffness ($ k $): 2.0 N/m
- Initial displacement: 1.0 m
- Initial velocity: 0.0 m/s

**Expected Behavior:**
- Natural frequency: $ \omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 $ rad/s
- Damping ratio: $ \zeta = \frac{c}{2\sqrt{mk}} = \frac{0.2}{2\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.071 $ (underdamped)
- The system should exhibit oscillatory behavior with exponential decay

**Observations:**
If you plot out the results of Case 1, it will be like the following:

!['Mass-Spring-Damper System Without External Force'](figures/mass_spring_damper_without_force.png "Plot of Case 1")

From the result we can observe:
- The position plot shows decaying oscillations
- The velocity leads the position by 90 degrees phase
- Amplitude decreases exponentially due to energy dissipation in the damper
- System exhibits underdamped behavior characteristic of $ \zeta < 1 $

### Case 2: Forced Vibration

**External Force:**
$$ 
F(t) = 5.0 \cdot \sin(2\pi \cdot 0.5 \cdot t) = 5.0 \cdot \sin(\pi t) 
$$

- Amplitude: 5.0 N
- Frequency: 0.5 Hz ($ \omega = \pi $ rad/s)

If you plot out the results of Case 2, it will be like the following:

!['Mass-Spring-Damper System With External Force'](figures/mass_spring_damper_with_force.png "Plot of Case 2")

**Analysis:**
- Driving frequency (0.5 Hz) is different from natural frequency ($ \approx 0.225 $ Hz)
- System shows combined transient and steady-state response
- Initially dominated by natural frequency response
- Eventually synchronizes with driving frequency
- Steady-state amplitude determined by frequency response characteristics

### Key Physical Insights

1. **Energy Conservation**: In free vibration, mechanical energy 
converts between potential ($ \frac{1}{2}kx^2 $) and kinetic (
$ \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2 $) forms, with gradual dissipation through damping.

2. **Resonance**: If the driving frequency matched the natural 
frequency $ \omega = \omega_n $, we would observe resonance with much larger amplitudes.

3. **Phase Relationships**: 
   - Velocity leads position by $ 90^\circ $
   - Acceleration leads velocity by $ 90^\circ $
   - In forced vibration, the phase between force and response depends on frequency ratio $ \frac{\omega}{\omega_n} $

4. **Damping Effects**:
   - Critical damping ($ \zeta = 1 $): No oscillations, fastest return to equilibrium
   - Underdamping ($ \zeta < 1 $): Oscillatory decay (our case)
   - Overdamping ($ \zeta > 1 $): Slow non-oscillatory return

## Conclusion

The mass-spring-damper simulation successfully demonstrates:
- ✅ Accurate implementation of the physical model
- ✅ Clear visualization of both free and forced vibration
- ✅ Proper handling of initial conditions and external forcing
- ✅ Physically realistic behavior matching theoretical predictions

This simulation provides valuable insights into dynamic system behavior 
and serves as a foundation for more complex mechanical system analyses.
